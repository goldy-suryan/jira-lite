# Jira Lite 🚀
#### Node.js | GraphQL | PostgreSQL | Redis | Next.js | AWS S3

A lightweight Jira-inspired project management tool built with a modern **MERN + GraphQL** stack.
It supports **real-time collaboration, task management, activity tracking, and team-based project workflows.**

This project was built as a **full-stack system design practice**, focusing on scalable architecture, real-time communication, and production-ready backend patterns.

# 🧩 System Design

This project was designed to mimic real-world project management tools like Jira while keeping the architecture modular and scalable.

### High Level Architecture

Frontend communicates with the backend using GraphQL. The backend manages business logic through service layers and interacts with PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM.

Real-time communication is implemented using GraphQL subscriptions backed by **Redis Pub/Sub** (used as a distributed event bus for GraphQL subscriptions).

File uploads are handled via AWS S3 using signed URLs to avoid routing large files through the backend server.

```
Client (Next.js)
      │
      │ GraphQL
      ▼
Apollo Server (Node.js + Express)
      │
      ├── PostgreSQL
      │       └── relational data (projects, tasks, activities)
      │
      ├── Redis
      │       └── pub/sub for GraphQL subscriptions
      │
      └── AWS S3
              └── file storage
```

---

## Database Design

The system uses relational modeling with junction tables to manage many-to-many relationships.

Example:

Users ↔ Projects (Many-to-Many)

```
users
projects
user_project_junction
```

Tasks belong to a project and may be assigned to a user.

```
projects
   │
   └── tasks
           │
           ├── comments
           └── activities
```

---

## Real-Time Communication

Real-time updates for comments are implemented using GraphQL subscriptions.

To allow scalability across multiple server instances, Redis Pub/Sub is used as the event transport layer.

```
Client A comment
        │
        ▼
GraphQL Mutation
        │
        ▼
Redis Pub/Sub
        │
        ▼
GraphQL Subscription
        │
        ▼
Client B receives comment instantly
```

---

## Task Positioning Strategy

Tasks are ordered using a **fractional indexing approach** to avoid reordering the entire list during drag-and-drop operations.

Example:

```
TODO column

Task A  → position 10000
Task B  → position 20000
Task C  → position 30000
```

When a new task is inserted between A and B:

```
New Task → position 15000
```

This approach significantly reduces database writes during drag-and-drop operations.

---

## Error Handling Strategy

Error handling is centralized using GraphQL error formatting.

Frontend interceptors display user-friendly error notifications, while backend services throw domain-specific errors.

This keeps the service layer clean while maintaining consistent error responses across the application.

---

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed with scalability in mind:

• Stateless backend architecture
• Redis-based pub/sub for horizontal scaling
• Direct S3 uploads using signed URLs
• Service layer abstraction for maintainability

These patterns allow the application to scale to multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.
