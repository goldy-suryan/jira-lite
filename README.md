# Jira Lite 🚀
#### Node.js | GraphQL | PostgreSQL | Redis | Next.js | AWS (EC2 + S3 + CloudFront)

A lightweight Jira-inspired project management tool built with a modern **Next.js + GraphQL + Node.js + PostgreSQL** stack.
It supports **real-time collaboration, task management, activity tracking, and team-based project workflows.**
Includes **AI-powered** task creation using **LLMs** for natural language input.

This project was built as a **full-stack system design practice**, focusing on scalable architecture, real-time communication, and production-ready backend patterns.

        │
        │ GraphQL
        ▼
Backend (Node.js + Express + Apollo Server)
        │
        ├── PostgreSQL (Sequelize ORM)

        │      └── GraphQL Subscriptions
        │
        └── AWS S3 (File Uploads)
```

---
## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

Frontend is deployed on Vercel while the backend runs on an AWS EC2 instance.

File uploads are stored in AWS S3 and served via CloudFront CDN for faster delivery.

#### Architecture:
```
Client (Browser)
     │
     ▼
Next.js (Vercel)
     │
     │ API Proxy
     ▼
Node.js Backend (AWS EC2)
     │
     ├── AI Service (Groq / LLM Integration)
     │      └── Natural language → structured task parsing
     ├── PostgreSQL
     ├── Redis
     └── AWS S3 (File Storage)
```

---
## API Proxy Layer

To avoid cross-site cookie restrictions between the frontend and backend domains,
a proxy layer is implemented using Next.js route handlers.

Client requests are sent to `/api/proxy/*` which forwards them to the backend API.

Benefits:

• Same-origin requests for authentication cookies  
• Cleaner API communication  
• Improved security for session-based authentication

---

## 🧩 System Design

This project was designed to mimic real-world project management tools like Jira while keeping the architecture modular and scalable.

### High Level Architecture

Frontend communicates with the backend using GraphQL. The backend manages business logic through service layers and interacts with PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM.

Real-time communication is implemented using GraphQL subscriptions backed by **Redis Pub/Sub** (used as a distributed event bus for GraphQL subscriptions).

File uploads are handled via AWS S3 using signed URLs to avoid routing large files through the backend server.

```
Client (Next.js)
      │
      │ GraphQL
      ▼
Apollo Server (Node.js + Express)
      │
      ├── PostgreSQL
      │       └── relational data (projects, tasks, activities)
      │
      ├── Redis
      │       └── pub/sub for GraphQL subscriptions
      │
      └── AWS S3
              └── file storage
```

---

## Database Design

The system uses relational modeling with junction tables to manage many-to-many relationships.

Example:

Users ↔ Projects (Many-to-Many)

```
users
projects
user_project_junction
```

Tasks belong to a project and may be assigned to a user.

```
projects
   │
   └── tasks
           │
           ├── comments
           └── activities
```

---

## Real-Time Communication

Real-time updates for comments are implemented using GraphQL subscriptions.

To allow scalability across multiple server instances, Redis Pub/Sub is used as the event transport layer.

```
Client A comment
        │
        ▼
GraphQL Mutation
        │
        ▼
Redis Pub/Sub
        │
        ▼
GraphQL Subscription
        │
        ▼
Client B receives comment instantly
```

---
### Notifications

* Real-time notifications for:
  - Task assignment
  - Comments

* Click-to-mark-as-read functionality
* Unread notification indicator

### Notification Flow
```
User Action (e.g., comment / assign)
        │
        ▼
Backend Event Trigger
        │
        ▼
Database (store notification)
        │
        ▼
Redis Pub/Sub
        │
        ▼
GraphQL Subscription
        │
        ▼
Client receives notification instantly
        │
        ▼
User clicks → mark as read (mutation)
```

---

## Task Positioning Strategy

Tasks are ordered using a **fractional indexing approach** to avoid reordering the entire list during drag-and-drop operations.

Example:

```
TODO column

Task A  → position 10000
Task B  → position 20000
Task C  → position 30000
```

When a new task is inserted between A and B:

```
New Task → position 15000
```

This approach significantly reduces database writes during drag-and-drop operations.

---

## Error Handling Strategy

Error handling is centralized using GraphQL error formatting.

Frontend interceptors display user-friendly error notifications, while backend services throw domain-specific errors.

This keeps the service layer clean while maintaining consistent error responses across the application.

---

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed with scalability in mind:

• Stateless backend architecture
• Redis-based pub/sub for horizontal scaling
• Direct S3 uploads using signed URLs
• Service layer abstraction for maintainability

These patterns allow the application to scale to multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.


---
